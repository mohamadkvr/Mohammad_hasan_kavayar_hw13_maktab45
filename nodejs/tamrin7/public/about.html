          To increase the reputation of the marque in this country, QAF Auto committed its resources to raising the standards of service to a higher level. Customer focus is the order of the day. BMW owners are kept up-to-date on a regular basis with existing and new developments. QAF Auto continually conducts service promotions to encourage. </p>

As the interest in BMW cars continues to grow in Brunei, QAF Auto looks to reassess its goals for the future. One element though will always remain constant: its promise to provide efficient, value-added services to all its customers.
